The Workings of Quantum Anomaly Detection(One-class Classifiers)

This repository contains the workings of a research project made at Mastricht University finished on June 2023:

Quantum computing has sparked a global frenzy, captivating minds with its immense potential 
to transform the world of computation. Among its many promises, anomaly detection
stands tall as a domain ripe for disruption. Why, some might ask? The answer lies in this
technology’s potential speed and precision, enabling us to identify elusive and extraordinary
data points or behaviors. In this project, we explore the current landscape of anomaly detection methods, 
pitting the quantum realm against its classical counterpart. Our quest involves
comparing tried-and-true methodologies, including kernel PCA, support vector machines, and
fully connected autoencoders, against their quantum counterparts — the variational quantum
classifier as one class classifier and the quantum support vector machine. As our investigation
unfolds, a revelation emerges, a noticeable implementation gap separating these methodological categories. 
The scales tip overwhelmingly in favor of classical methods, their established
prowess shining through. However, as we delve deeper into the intricacies of complex and
inseparable data, a lingering question emerges: Could quantum anomaly detection techniques
hold a hidden advantage for specific data types intertwined with quantum elements?
